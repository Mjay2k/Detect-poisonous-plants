# Detect Poisonous Plants

An Ai service deployed on the Web with the help of Microsoft's Azure services that uses custom vision to separate poisonous or toxic plants(for Humans, Dogs, and Cats) from safe plants. It is also capable of detecting whether the plants are present near the picture capturer or not. In case they are not present it will let users know that there are no plants in the concerned uploaded image.

Some of the Core Technologies that were used in the project are as follows:

* Azure Custom Vision
* Azure Web Apps
* Azure Cognitive Services
* Azure Storage Accounts
